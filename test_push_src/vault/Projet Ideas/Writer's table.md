## Projet description
Electron app that lets the user import a song, defines some of its aspect (e.g tempo, start and ending of voices) and helps the writer write lyrics for its song.

Like a note app, but with for example the song's part in the interline, and some keyboard shortcut to play the next/previous N parts etc...
