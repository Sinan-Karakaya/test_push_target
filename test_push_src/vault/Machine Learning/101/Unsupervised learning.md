The unsupervised learning is very similar to the [[Supervised learning]]. The only difference is that the labels are not given in the data set.


| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Label |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----- |
| 6 | 1 | 2 | ? |
| 1 | 0 | 14 | ? |
| 2 | 3 | 5 | ? |

## So how do I train my model ?

How can I train my model without having the expected result for comparison ? This would be achieved with guesses pretty much. When trying to detect for example different pictures of different animals, the model would still be able after a certain time to group them by looking for similarities.
